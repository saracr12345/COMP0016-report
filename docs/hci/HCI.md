# HCI

## Section 1 - User Requirements for HCI

> **Note:** Various aspects of our project have changed since the HCI Component of the project was concluded.  
> We focused on calibration for our HCI component but this was scrapped by our client after deciding that calibration was to not be used with MotionInput.

Our theme is **"Autocalibrating Accuracy,"** and our goal is to minimise failure modes and enhance the accuracy of MotionInput, a system that allows users to play games and control their computers using body movements. We aim to cater to various needs and capabilities, ensuring that MotionInput is accessible and inclusive for all users.

To better understand the impact and potential improvements of MotionInput, we conducted interviews with a diverse set of users, including:

1. A teacher who uses MotionInput in the classroom setting.
2. A 65-year-old retiree who uses MotionInput for leisure activities and daily tasks.
3. A pseudo-user scenario representing a child with cerebral palsy, to gain insights into the unique requirements and challenges faced by individuals with motor impairments.

These interviews provided invaluable insights into how MotionInput could be optimised for each user group, addressing their specific needs and minimising the failure modes they face.
