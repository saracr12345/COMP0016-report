# HCI

</div>

_(Please note that our project requirements and specifications have been refined throughout development to align with the feasibility of creating an effective and practical platform.)_

<div class="brown">

## Section 1 - Discovering User Requirements ​

</div>

Our research focused on identifying the most effective method for gathering user feedback to refine our app’s functionality. After evaluating various data collection approaches, we determined that a questionnaire combining multiple-choice and short paragraph questions would be the most suitable. This method ensures clarity and accessibility for our target audience—children aged 8 to 14—allowing them to express their thoughts effectively.

To gain deeper insights into user expectations and necessary functionalities, we collected responses from two representative users:

* An 8-year-old student, providing a perspective on how younger users interact with the app and their intuitive expectations.
* A 14-year-old student, offering feedback on usability, feature preferences, and areas for improvement from an older user’s standpoint.

These responses serve as key references in shaping our app’s design, ensuring it meets the needs and expectations of its intended audience.
