# HCI

## Section 1 - Discovering user requirements ​

​Our research focused on identifying the most effective method for gathering user feedback to refine our app’s functionality. After evaluating various data collection approaches, we determined that a questionnaire combining multiple-choice and short paragraph questions would be the most suitable. This method ensures clarity and accessibility for our target audience—children aged 8 to 14—allowing them to express their thoughts effectively.


To gain deeper insights into user expectations and necessary functionalities, we collected responses from two representative users:
* An 8-year-old student, providing a perspective on how younger users interact with the app and their intuitive expectations.
* A 14-year-old student, offering feedback on usability, feature preferences, and areas for improvement from an older user’s standpoint.


These responses serve as key references in shaping our app’s design, ensuring it meets the needs and expectations of its intended audience.

## Section 2 - User Personas: Exploring How Target Users Engage with the App
### Section 2.1 - Scenario 1: Leo, an Aspiring Young Game Creator
* Leo, an 8-year-old, logs onto the app to create something unique.
* The colorful buttons and simple layout encourage free experimentation.
* He selects backgrounds, characters, and objects using easy prompts.
* Instant feedback shows the effects of each change, keeping him excited.
* He enjoys discovering what each button does.
* His friends are impressed by his creation, boosting his pride.
* The app fosters his creativity and confidence in game-building.
